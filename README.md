Test repository for Engineering Agent integration

## 🤖 Engineering Agent Integration

This repository is integrated with an AI-powered Engineering Agent that can help you implement features, fix bugs, and complete development tasks automatically.

### Quick Start Guide

Get started with the Engineering Agent in 3 simple steps:

1. **Install & Configure**
   - Set up the Engineering Agent in your development environment
   - Configure your API keys and repository access
   - Link this repository to the agent

2. **Define Your Task**
   - Describe what you want to build, fix, or improve
   - Provide context, requirements, and any relevant files
   - The agent will analyze and plan the implementation

3. **Review & Merge**
   - The agent creates a pull request with the changes
   - Review the code and test the implementation
   - Merge when you're satisfied with the results

### Usage Examples

#### Implementing a Feature

```bash
# Request a new feature implementation
agent implement "Add user authentication system with JWT tokens"

# The agent will:
# - Analyze requirements
# - Design the implementation
# - Write the code
# - Add tests
# - Create a pull request
```

#### Fixing a Bug

```bash
# Request a bug fix
agent fix "Users can't login when password contains special characters"

# The agent will:
# - Investigate the issue
# - Identify the root cause
# - Implement the fix
# - Add regression tests
# - Create a pull request
```

#### Quick Task

```bash
# Complete a quick development task
agent task "Update dependencies and fix any breaking changes"

# The agent will:
# - Update package dependencies
# - Run tests and identify issues
# - Fix breaking changes
# - Verify everything works
# - Create a pull request
```

### Development
